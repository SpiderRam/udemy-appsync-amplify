## Amplify CLI

[AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli) is a JavaScript library which simplifies the development process. It has many modules, such as Auth, Analytics, Storage, API, Caching, UI Components, and more. These provide boilerplate code to get started quickly.

In order to work with Amplify, you need to [install the CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install) and run `amplify configure`, then follow the prompts.
